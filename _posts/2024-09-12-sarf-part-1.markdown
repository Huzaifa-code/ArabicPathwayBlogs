# Sarf <span class="ar text-2xl" >صرف</span> 


All <span class="ar text-2xl" > صرف  </span>families can be grouped into two large groups.

## 1. <span class="ar text-4xl" > المُجَرَّد </span> 
The distinguishing feature of these families is that their container (in the هو version of past tense) has no extra letters, it only consists of حركات (vowels). For example: 

<span class="ar text-4xl">
نَصَرَ   كَرُمَ  سَمِعَ    ضَرَبَ   فَهِمَ   كَبُرَ  
</span>


Families in this category are unique and have additional members:  
- <span class="ar text-3xl"> اسم الة </span>(tools/devices)  
- <span class="ar text-3xl">  اسم تفضيل </span>(comparative/superlatives)  
- <span class="ar text-3xl">  اسم صفة </span>(adjectives for permanent qualities)  
- <span class="ar text-3xl">  اسم مُبالَغَة </span> (a hyperbolized form of اسم فاعل)

### 2. <span class="ar text-4xl" >  المَزِيْد فِيْه </span>
The container always consists of extra letters in addition to the حركات (vowels).

Examples:
<span class="ar">
اِنْقلب  أسلم  جاهد    تفرّق   تعاوَنَ    اِستغفر  
</span>


<div class="note">

    before moving forward in the Sarf Study
</div>

### Family 2: <span class="ar" >  باب تَفْعِيْل  </span>
In Classical Arabic tradition, name follows the pattern of Masdar.

#### Rhetorical Implications of Family 2: 
Words from this family are generally مُتَعَدٍّ and indicate that the action is <span class="hl">repetitive and takes place over a long period of time</span> .  
For example, نَزَّلَ means to reveal gradually and repetitively over time. This verb is used to describe the revelation of the Quran over 23 years.

This pattern can also imply hyperbole. For example, قَتَّلَ means to massacre, whereas قَتَلَ simply means to kill.

### <span class="ar">Family 3: باب مُفَاعَلَة (Mufāʿala)</span>
There are 2 Masdars, with the second one being more commonly used in modern Arabic.

#### Rhetorical Implications of Family 3:
Action is <span class="hl">directed</span>  from one individual/party to another.  
For example, عاقب means to punish, which is something one individual/party does to another.

### Family 4:  <span class="ar" > باب إفعال </span>

#### Rhetorical Implications of Family 4:
Action is completed <span class="hl">immediately</span>  and all at once.  
For example, أَنَزَلَ means to send something down immediately and at once.

### Family 5: <span class="ar" >  باب تفعُّلً  </span>

#### Rhetorical Implications of Family 5:
Words from this family are predominantly <span class="hl ar"> لازم (intransitive)</span> and can sometimes imply that the action took <span class="hl">effort</span>  to complete.


### Transitive v/s Intransitive Fi'l <span class="ar">فعل</span> 

1 .  Transitive Fi'l (متعدٍ):
A transitive Fi'l is one that requires a direct object to make sense. The action of the Fi'l moves from the subject to an object. In Arabic, these Fi'ls are known as Fi‘l Muta‘addi (فعل متعدٍ).
Example:
أَنزَلَ (anzala) – "He sent down."
<p class="q"> ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِىٓ  أَنزَلَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ  وَٱلْمِيزَانَ ۗ وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ قَرِيبٌۭ ١٧ </p>
The verb "sent down" requires an object (the book) to complete its meaning.


2 .  Intransitive Fi'l (لازم):
An intransitive Fi'l is one that does not require an object to complete its meaning. The action is complete in itself and does not transfer to an object. In Arabic, these are called Fi‘l Lazim (فعل لازم).

Example:
جَاءَ (jaa’a) – "He came."
The verb "came" does not need an object to complete its meaning.

<p class="note">
Important Note:
Some verbs in Arabic can be both transitive and intransitive depending on the context and additional elements (like prepositions). For example, ذَهَبَ (dhahaba) can be intransitive, meaning "he went," but when combined with a preposition, it can take an object, such as ذهب إلى (dhahaba ila – "he went to").
