# Sarf <span class="ar text-2xl" >صرف</span> 

### Resources: 
- [ejtaal.net](http://ejtaal.net) - Lane's Lexicon, Hans Wehr
- [Arabic nahw & sarf Blogs](https://thearabicpages.com/)
- [Quran Hive - Sarf of word](https://quranhive.com/surah/)

All <span class="ar text-2xl" >  ‫صرف‬  </span>families can be grouped into two large groups.

## 1. <span class="ar text-4xl" > ‫المُجَرَّد‬ </span> 
The distinguishing feature of these families is that their container (in the هو version of past tense) has no extra letters, it only consists of حركات (vowels). For example: 

<span class="ar text-4xl">
نَصَرَ   كَرُمَ  سَمِعَ    ضَرَبَ   فَهِمَ   كَبُرَ  
</span>


Families in this category are unique and have additional members:  
- <span class="ar text-3xl"> اسم الة </span>(tools/devices)  
- <span class="ar text-3xl">  اسم تفضيل </span>(comparative/superlatives)  
- <span class="ar text-3xl">  اسم صفة </span>(adjectives for permanent qualities)  
- <span class="ar text-3xl">  اسم مُبالَغَة </span> (a hyperbolized form of اسم فاعل)

### 2. <span class="ar text-4xl" >  المَزِيْد فِيْه </span>
The container always consists of extra letters in addition to the حركات (vowels).

Examples:
<span class="ar text-4xl">
اِنْقلب  أسلم  جاهد    تفرّق   تعاوَنَ    اِستغفر  
</span>

<div class="bg-yellow-200 text-lg">

#### Rhetorical Implications of Family 2: 
Words from this family are generally مُتَعَدٍّ and indicate that the action is repetitive and takes place over a long period of time.  
For example, نَزَّلَ means to reveal gradually and repetitively over time. This verb is used to describe the revelation of the Quran over 23 years.

This pattern can also imply hyperbole. For example, قَتَّلَ means to massacre, whereas قَتَلَ simply means to kill.

### <span class="ar">Family 3: باب مُفَاعَلَة (Mufāʿala)</span>
There are 2 Masdars, with the second one being more commonly used in modern Arabic.
