# Sarf <span class="arabic-text" >صرف</span> 

### Resources:

All <span class="arabic-text" >  ‫صرف‬  </span>families can be grouped into two large groups.

### 1. <span class="arabic-text" > ‫المُجَرَّد‬ </span> 
The distinguishing feature of these families is that their container (in the هو version of past tense) has no extra letters, it only consists of حركات (vowels). For example: 

نَصَرَ   كَرُمَ  سَمِعَ    ضَرَبَ   فَهِمَ   كَبُرَ  

Families in this category are unique and have additional members:  
- اسم الة (tools/devices)  
- اسم تفضيل (comparative/superlatives)  
- اسم صفة (adjectives for permanent qualities)  
- اسم مُبالَغَة (a hyperbolized form of اسم فاعل)

### 2. <span class="arabic-text" >  المَزِيْد فِيْه </span>
The container always consists of extra letters in addition to the حركات (vowels).

Examples:
اِنْقلب  أسلم  جاهد    تفرّق   تعاوَنَ    اِستغفر

### Family 2: <span class="arabic-text" >  باب تَفْعِيْل  </span>
In Classical Arabic tradition, name follows the pattern of Masdar.

#### Rhetorical Implications of Family 2: 
Words from this family are generally مُتَعَدٍّ and indicate that the action is repetitive and takes place over a long period of time.  
For example, نَزَّلَ means to reveal gradually and repetitively over time. This verb is used to describe the revelation of the Quran over 23 years.

This pattern can also imply hyperbole. For example, قَتَّلَ means to massacre, whereas قَتَلَ simply means to kill.

### <span class="arabic-text">Family 3: باب مُفَاعَلَة (Mufāʿala)</span>
There are 2 Masdars, with the second one being more commonly used in modern Arabic.

#### Rhetorical Implications of Family 3:
Action is directed from one individual/party to another.  
For example, عاقب means to punish, which is something one individual/party does to another.

### Family 4:  <span class="arabic-text" > باب إفعال </span>

#### Rhetorical Implications of Family 4:
Action is completed immediately and all at once.  
For example, أَنَزَلَ means to send something down immediately and at once.

### Family 5: <span class="arabic-text" >  باب تفعُّلً  </span>

#### Rhetorical Implications of Family 5:
Words from this family are predominantly لازم (intransitive) and can sometimes imply that the action took effort to complete.
