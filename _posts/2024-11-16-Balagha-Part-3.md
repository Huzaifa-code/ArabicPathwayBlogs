## أُسْلُوب

أُسْلُوب (Usloob)  -  refers to style or manner of speech & writing

There are 3 main Usloob :

### 1. Usloob al-Ilmi

Usloob al-Ilmi refers to the academic style used for clear, precise, and logical communication of knowledge. Its primary focus is on clarity and objectivity, making it suitable for academic writing, scientific research, and factual explanations.

Characteristics:
* Clarity and Precision: Avoids ambiguity and figurative language to ensure that the message is understood exactly as intended.
* Logical Organization: Information is presented in a structured and coherent manner, often with headings, numbered lists, and systematic explanations.
* Neutral Tone: The tone is free from emotional or artistic elements; it focuses solely on the content and facts.
* Technical Terminology: Uses specialized terms and vocabulary relevant to the subject matter.

**This style avoids rhetorical or emotional elements, focusing entirely on factual information.**

### 2. Usloob al-Adabi

Usloob al-Adabi refers to the artistic or literary style, characterized by its focus on beauty, creativity, and emotional appeal. It is widely used in poetry, prose, and storytelling, aiming to move the reader emotionally and intellectually.

Characteristics:

* Rhythmic and Musical Quality: The words and sentences are often chosen for their harmony and rhythm, especially in poetry.
* Subjectivity: Reflects the writer’s emotions, opinions, and personal perspective

**This style is rich in imagery and evokes emotional responses from the audience.**

### 3. Usloob al-Khitabi

Usloob al-Khitabi refers to the oratorical or persuasive style, used in speeches, sermons, and public addresses to persuade, inspire, or motivate the audience. It is designed to engage listeners and convey the speaker’s message with impact and eloquence.

Characteristics:
* Persuasion and Motivation: Combines logic with emotional appeal to convince and inspire the audience.

## Khabar -  خبر in Balagha under Ilm Ma'ani

We studied خبر in Jumla Ismiyyah , خبر in Balagha is different then خبر in Nahw. Just like the word "site" means different for construction worker and web developer.

Khabar in Balagha - Khabar is a statement that can be verified.

If it is true then, it does't matter whether we say or not , it will still exist. Our speech didn't bring khabar into existence , it was already in existence.

### Purposes of Khabar :

1. فاءِدَةُ الخبر

    When we speak and give information to someone who didn't know about it .

2. لازِمُ الخبر 

    When we give information to someone who already knows about it .

    Example - you say to your brother "You have exam tommorow" and he already knows about it
