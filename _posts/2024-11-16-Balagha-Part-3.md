## أُسْلُوب

أُسْلُوب (Usloob)  -  refers to style or manner of speech & writing

There are 3 main Usloob :

### 1. Usloob al-Ilmi

Usloob al-Ilmi refers to the academic style used for clear, precise, and logical communication of knowledge. Its primary focus is on clarity and objectivity, making it suitable for academic writing, scientific research, and factual explanations.

Characteristics:
* Clarity and Precision: Avoids ambiguity and figurative language to ensure that the message is understood exactly as intended.
* Logical Organization: Information is presented in a structured and coherent manner, often with headings, numbered lists, and systematic explanations.
* Neutral Tone: The tone is free from emotional or artistic elements; it focuses solely on the content and facts.
* Technical Terminology: Uses specialized terms and vocabulary relevant to the subject matter.

**This style avoids rhetorical or emotional elements, focusing entirely on factual information.**

### 2. Usloob al-Adabi

Usloob al-Adabi refers to the artistic or literary style, characterized by its focus on beauty, creativity, and emotional appeal. It is widely used in poetry, prose, and storytelling, aiming to move the reader emotionally and intellectually.

### 3. Usloob al-Khitabi

Usloob al-Khitabi refers to the oratorical or persuasive style, used in speeches, sermons, and public addresses to persuade, inspire, or motivate the audience. It is designed to engage listeners and convey the speaker’s message with impact and eloquence.

## Khabar -  خبر in Balagha under Ilm Ma'ani

We studied خبر in Jumla Ismiyyah , خبر in Balagha is different then خبر in Nahw. Just like the word "site" means different for construction worker and web developer.

Khabar in Balagha - Khabar is a statement that can be verified.

If it is true then, it does't matter whether we say or not , it will still exist. Our speech didn't bring khabar into existence , it was already in existence.

### Purposes of Khabar :

1. فاءِدَةُ الخبر

    When we speak and give information to someone who didn't know about it .

2. لازِمُ الخبر 

    When we give information to someone who already knows about it .

    Example - you say to your brother "You have exam tommorow" and he already knows about it

### 3 Audiences of Khabar :

In **Arabic rhetoric (Balagha)**, the audience of a **Khabar** (a statement conveying information) is called **المُخاطَب** (the addressed person). The purpose and delivery of **Khabar** depend on the type of audience. The audience can be classified into three main categories based on their attitude towards the information being conveyed:

---

### **1. Neutral Audience (خالي الذهن)**
- **Definition**: This audience is unaware of the information being conveyed. They have no prior knowledge or preconception about it. 
- **Purpose of Khabar**: To **inform** (إفادة الخبر).
- **Characteristics**:
  - The statement is delivered in a straightforward and clear manner.
  - No emphasis is needed since the audience has no reason to doubt or reject the information.
- **Example**:
  - **الجوُّ جميلٌ** (The weather is beautiful.)
  - The speaker is merely informing the audience about the state of the weather.

---

### **2. Doubtful Audience (المتردد)**
- **Definition**: This audience has doubts or is uncertain about the truth of the information. They require clarification or evidence to be convinced.
- **Purpose of Khabar**: To **confirm** (تأكيد الخبر) and remove doubt.
- **Characteristics**:
  - The statement is emphasized using rhetorical tools, such as:
    - **Particles of emphasis**: مثل **إنَّ** (indeed), **قد** (certainly).
    - Repetition for reinforcement.
  - The goal is to persuade the audience of the truthfulness of the information.
- **Example**:
  - **إنَّ الجوَّ جميلٌ** (Indeed, the weather is beautiful.)
  - The emphasis **إنَّ** reassures the listener that the weather is indeed beautiful, removing any doubts.

---

### **3. Refusing Audience (المنكر)**
- **Definition**: This audience denies or rejects the information being conveyed. They need strong evidence or a forceful assertion to be convinced.
- **Purpose of Khabar**: To **establish** (إقامة الحجة) and overcome their denial.
- **Characteristics**:
  - The statement uses **strong emphasis** and **multiple levels of confirmation**, such as:
    - **Swearing by oaths**: مثل **والله** (By Allah!).
    - Combining tools like **إنّ**, **لام التوكيد** (the emphatic ل), or **قد**.
  - The purpose is to compel the audience to accept the truth despite their initial denial.
- **Example**:
  - **واللهِ إنَّ الجوَّ لجميلٌ** (By Allah, indeed the weather is truly beautiful.)
  - The oath **والله**, combined with **إنَّ** and **لام التوكيد**, strongly affirms the statement for someone who refuses to believe it.

### **Comparison of the Three Types**

| **Type**            | **Audience Attitude**    | **Purpose of Khabar**   | **Features**                            | **Example**                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Neutral (خالي الذهن)** | No knowledge            | Inform (إفادة الخبر)      | No emphasis                              | **الجوُّ جميلٌ** (The weather is beautiful.)   |
| **Doubtful (المتردد)** | Uncertain               | Confirm (تأكيد الخبر)     | Use of emphasis tools (e.g., **إنّ**)    | **إنَّ الجوَّ جميلٌ** (Indeed, the weather is beautiful.) |
| **Refusing (المنكر)**  | Denies the information   | Establish (إقامة الحجة)   | Strong emphasis (oaths, repetition)      | **واللهِ إنَّ الجوَّ لجميلٌ** (By Allah, the weather is truly beautiful.) |

### Practical Use in the Qur'an:
The Qur'an uses different levels of **Khabar** to address these audiences, depending on their attitude towards the message of Islam. For instance:

- **Neutral audience**: Clear and direct guidance, e.g., **وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ** (And establish prayer) [Surah Al-Baqarah 2:43].
- **Doubtful audience**: Emphasis is added, e.g., **إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ** (Indeed, Allah is over all things competent) [Surah Al-Baqarah 2:20].
- **Refusing audience**: Strong oaths and emphasis, e.g., **وَٱللَّهِ إِنَّكُمْ لَفِى ضَلَـٰلٍ مُّبِينٍ** (By Allah, indeed you are in manifest error) [Surah Yusuf 12:95].
