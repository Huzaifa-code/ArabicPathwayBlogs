Assalamualaikum

I hope you all are doing well. Starting From this blog post we will start exploring Grammar of an ayah every Friday Inshallah

So Let's Start with Surah Kahf 

If you ever feel stuck somewhere, you can ask questions in the comments section below and the concept that you are not aware of you can find resources like
notes, books, youtube channels/playlist from the Resources section

### Surah Kahf Ayah 1 - 18:1


 ٱلْحَمْدُ   لِلَّهِ   ٱلَّذِىٓ   أَنزَلَ   عَلَىٰ   عَبْدِهِ   ٱلْكِتَٰبَ   وَلَمْ   يَجْعَل   لَّهُۥ   عِوَجَا  ۜ   


We will explore ayah on different levels starting from beginner level to intermediate level

### Beginner Level 1 - Basic Nahw : 

Let's first figure out اسم، فعل and حرف
in the ayah

<span class="hl xl">
ٱلْحَمْدُ 
</span>
has ال so its definately an اسم since only اسم can have ال

Now let's see 4 properties اسم of this word :

1. Status : Since it has ending "u" sound ( Dhamma -  ُ ). Therefore it is in Rafa status = مَرْفُوعٌ
2. Number : It doesn't have ending combination ( like oona,iian, aani etc ), it has ending sound "u" therefore number 1 - Singular
3. Gender : Since it does't show any sign for it to be feminine, therfore by default it is Masculine
4. Type : Clearly it has ال in beginning therefore it is Proper


<span class="hl xl">
لِلَّهِ 
</span>

لِ is Harf Jarr and it makes the next Ism - Majroor مَجْرُور 

Therefore لَفْظُ الجَلالَة ( Word Allah is Referred by لفظُ الجلالة  ) is مَجْرُور .

لِلَّهِ is jaar-Majroor Fragment 


<span class="hl xl">
    ٱلَّذِىٓ 
</span>

ٱلَّذِىٓ is Ism Mowsool, so it is a type of Ism


<span class="hl xl">
     عَلَىٰ
</span>
 عَلَىٰ is Harf Jarr and it makes the next Ism - Majroor مَجْرُور 


<span class="hl xl">
عَبْدِهِ 
</span>
 عَبْدِ is an Ism and it is Majroor because of  عَلَىٰ 

There is more to it, see the ending - it is light and has no ال and next to it is attached pronoun ه and attached pronouns are in Nasb or jarr status.

Since both of these Ism meet the requirement to be Idhafa Fragment - Mudhaf_Mudhaf Ilay Fragment therefore it is an Idhafa

<span class="hl xl">
ٱلْكِتَٰبَ 
</span>

ٱلْكِتَٰبَ  is an Ism - its properties are : 

- Status = Nasb
- Number = Singular 
- Gender = Masculine by default
- Type : Proper because of ال

<span class="hl xl">
    وَلَمْ 
</span>

و a harf ataf - connector word that connects 2 fragment or sentences together
and لَمْ is Lightest harf that makes the Fi'l Mudhar'i فعل مضارع Lightest


<span class="hl xl">
ْيَجْعَل 
</span>

ْيَجْعَل is Fi'l Mudhar'i - since it starts with ي and it is lightest مجزوم because of لَمْ

And Inside Doer is "He" - Default


<span class="hl xl">
لَّهُۥ
</span>

لَّهُۥ is Jaar-Majroor Fragment 


<span class="hl xl">
عِوَجًا
</span>

Ism - Nasab - Status, Number - Single , Gender - Masculine (default), Type - common


That's it for now.

We will go more deeper on next Friday Inshallah
