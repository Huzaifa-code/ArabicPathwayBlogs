## Nahw Intro 

let's Begin our study of Nahw with words in Arabic 

There are 3 types of words in arabic :

1. اِسْمٌ

2. فِعْلٌ

3. حَرْفٌ

Any word that you see in arabic is going to be of one of these type.

### اِسْمٌ 
An اسم is person,place,thing,idea,adjective,adverb and more.

Examples : 
    
    Person - Muhammad, Abdullah,teacher,writer

    Place - Turkey, Palestine, School, Shop

    Thing - book, pen, laptop, camera

    Idea - Justice, Happiness, Education

    Adjective - fast,exciting,tall,short (used to describe other words)

    Adverb - slowly, quickly (describe how an action took place)


### الفِعْلٌ

Fi'l is a word that is stuck in time - Past or present or future

Example : 
    He Stopped , He Gave, He learns, He will succeed

### الحَرْف

Word that doesn't make sense unless it is followed by an Ism or a Fi'l 

Example : to, from , in , with, if...


First Let's study Ism.

### Every Ism has 4 properties 
1.  الإعراب Status
2. جِنْس Gender
3. عدد Number
4. قسم Type

### 1. الإعراب I'raab - Status

Status tells what role is an Ism playing in the sentence, In Arabic Ism can have one of three forms.

Status 1 : Doer - <span class="hl">رَفْع</span>   Raf'a

Doer is the one who carries out an action

example :  He gave me the book.
Here action is "gave" and "He" is the doer of action

Raf'a is default status of an Ism, Doer is always Raf'a.
The term for "in the رفع status" in arabic is مَرْفُوْعٌ
.So in the above example "He" is in raf'a status = مَرْفُوْعٌ

Status 2 : The Detail - <span class="hl">نَصْب</span> 

The detail refers to additional information about the action. When looking for a detail in a sentence,
follow a two-step process:
1) Find the action and the doer
2) Everything else in the sentence is a detail

The term for "in the نَصْب status" in arabic is مَنْصُوبٌ

Status 3 : جَر status

One of the reason a word in Jarr is because it comes after <span>"of"</span>.
There are more reasons for an Ism to be Jarr we will discuss about it in the later blogs

Example :   The Book of Shoaib.

Here Shoaib i after "of" , so it is "in Jarr status" / مَجْرُور

Sometimes "of" is not clear and sentence may need to be rearranged.

Example : My Book = Book of mine . so here mine is after "of" so "mine" is in jarr status





### How to tell status of an Ism

In English we can tell status by its meaning. But in Arabic status is determined by a marker or sign at the end of the word - Harakaat حركات

There are 2 types of endings of an Ism - Ending Sound and Ending combination (letters added at the end of Ism)

Ending Combination : 

In Pair (Dual) = aani, ayni, ayni

In Plural ( 3 or more than 3 ) = una , eena, eena
