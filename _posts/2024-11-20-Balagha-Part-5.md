# إنشَاء Insha 

* True/False doesn't apply

* Doesn't hold true if you don't say it .

* For example, the command "Bring me water!" only holds significance within the act of communication itself.

* 5 kinds of insha are studied in balagha ( there are more but not studied in balagha ) : 
1. الأمر ( command )
2. النّهِي ( Forbidding )
3. الاستفهام ( Question )
4. التّمني ( Wishes )
5. النِداء ( Calling Someone )

1. First kind of إنشَاء 
الأمر

Command

While its primary function is to issue orders or requests, it can express a wide range of secondary meanings depending on the context

#### Forms of Amr
Amr can take various forms:
* Direct commands: These are straightforward orders like "Bring me water!".

* Requests: These are polite ways of asking someone to do something, often using specific grammatical structures or vocabulary.

* Rhetorical questions: These questions are not intended to elicit an answer but to make a statement or express an emotion

#### Secondary Meaning of Amr : 

- Emphasis or certainty: Using specific grammatical structures, such as a masdar in the mansoob case and nakirah form, intensifies the command, like saying "Help!" instead of "You should help".

- Supplication or pleading: Amr can be used to implore someone on a similar level or counsel someone, emphasizing the importance of the message. For example, "Listen to me! Take this seriously!"

- Threat or warning: Amr can convey a threat by challenging someone to do something impossible or implying a negative consequence. Phrases like "Say it again!" or "Hit me!" illustrate this.

- Permission or allowance: Amr can grant permission or indicate acceptance of a situation, such as "Cry or don't cry" or "Please sit."

- Contemplation or reflection: Amr can prompt the listener to think deeply about something by directing their attention to it, for instance, "Look at the sky!"

   Example:  
   - "Bring me water!"

3. **When certain Isms are "married" to Harf**

    عَلَيْكُمْ  أَنفُسَكُمْ  ۖ  لَا  يَضُرُّكُم  مَّن  ضَلَّ  إِذَا  ٱهْتَدَيْتُمْ 5:105

    you are responsible for your own souls; if anyone else goes astray it will not harm you so long as you follow the guidance

   Example:
