Assalamulaikum

In the preovious blog we have seen pronouns , Fragments : jaar-majroor, Harf Nasb and it's ism, Idhafa.

So Let's continue forward.

First let's see Special Mudhaf.

## Special Mudhaf مُضاف

There are some words in Arabic that always appear as a Mudhaf but they do not necessarily create meaning of belonging or possesion.

Memorize these words with their meaning :

Below Special Mudhaf are ظَرْف , ظرف is the arabic term for these words and they remain منصوب unless preceded by a Harf Jarr حرف جر

Below Special Mudhaf do not denote time or place ( ظرف ) and can appear in any status.

### الأسماء الخمسة

They are special because they commonly appear as Mudhaf and when they appear as Mudhaf they don't show their status through ending sound rather through ending letter attached to it  :

- مرفوع - End with و
- منصوب - End with ا - ألِف
- مجرور - End with ي

When they don't appear as Mudhaf they show status normally through ending sound

<p class="note lg">
    Remember when you call somebody and it is Mudhaf مُضاف then you have to make it nasb مَنْصوب . Example - يا أبا بَكْرٍ appears many times in hadiths, here أبا is مَنْصوب 
</p>

Example : 

إلى ذِي العرشِ

وَاللَّهُ ذُو الفَضْلِ العَظِيمِ


<span class="hl">18:83</span>  
<p class="lg">
وَيَسْـَٔلُونَكَ عَن ذِى ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ ۖ قُلْ سَأَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْهُ ذِكْرًا ٨٣
</p>

They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about Ⱬul-Qarnain. Say, “I will relate to you something of his narrative.”


3:74
<p class="lg">
يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ ۗ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ ٧٤
</p>

He chooses whoever He wills to receive His mercy. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.


18:86
<p class="lg" dir="rtl">
حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِى عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ وَوَجَدَ عِندَهَا قَوْمًا ۗ قُلْنَا يَـٰذَا ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ إِمَّآ أَن تُعَذِّبَ وَإِمَّآ أَن تَتَّخِذَ فِيهِمْ حُسْنًا ٨٦
</p>
<p class="hl">
يَـٰذَا ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ 
</p>

until he reached the setting ˹point˺ of the sun, which appeared to him to be setting in a spring of murky water, where he found some people. We said, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Either punish them or treat them kindly.”
