### Technical Definition of Balagha :

The technical definition of balāgha (بلاغة) is commonly summarized in Arabic as مُطَابَقَةُ الكَلاَمِ لِمُقْتَضَى الحَالِ (mutaqābatul kalām li-muqtaḍā al-ḥāl), which translates to "When speech corresponds to the needs of the situation"

Like if someone stole your phone, you will not explain everything about this thing like "That is a theif.I was just sitting at the cafe ...". You will just say "theif" and that is enough.

## Balagha is studied in 3 parts : 

1. Ilm Al-M'ani علم المعاني - 
	
	Language.linguistic techniques (Nahw and sarf) used to communicate (create) special meanings

	1. المُسْنَدُ     
	Musnad  -  What you saying about them
	2. المُسْنَدُ إلَيْهِ    Musnad Ilaih
	Who you talking about
	3. القيد   Qayd

Examples : 
		إِيَّاكَ  نَعْبُدُ  وَإِيَّاكَ  نَسْتَعِينُ 
		
Here in this ayah , Musnad Ilaih is "we" (who you talking about) and musnad is "worship and ask help"
		
۞ ٱللَّهُ  نُورُ  ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَٱلْأَرْضِ

Here Lafdul-Jalaalah is Musnad Ilaih,نُورُ Nur is Musnad and what is its restrictions - ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَٱلْأَرْضِ is Qayd 

ٱلْحَمْدُ  لِلَّهِ  رَبِّ  ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ 

Here ٱلْحَمْدُ is Musnad Ilaih (who you talking about), For Allah لِلَّهِ is Musnad

2. Ilm Al-Bayan علم البيان - Figures of speech
	Ilm al-Bayan is the science of "clarity" or "expression." It focuses on different ways of expressing the same idea, especially through figures of speech. It emphasizes how to convey meanings clearly, vividly, and powerfully. Key concepts include:

	Tashbih (تشبيه): Simile, where one thing is likened to another using words like "like" or "as."

	Isti'ara (استعارة): Metaphor, where one thing is implied to be another without using "like" or "as."

	Majaz (مجاز): Figurative language or idiom, where words are used in non-literal ways to add depth or nuance.

3. Ilm Al-Badee' علم البديع
