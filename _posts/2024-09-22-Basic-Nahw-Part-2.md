We were looking at 4 properties of Ism and we were at property 1 - Status in the part 1 
So let's move forward 

Subtopics under Status :

## Light & Heavy Ism

Light and Heavy is subtopic under status.

Notice that every word in Muslim Chart you memorized in the part 1 ends with 'n' sound like muslimu-n muslima-n , muslimi-n ...

These words are considered Heavy. Heavy is the Default. An ism is not made light unless there is a reason for it

In order to make a word light just remove the 'n' sound at the end.

1. If the Word ends in double accent ( التَّنْوِيْن ) , replace the double accent with a single حَرَكَة . For Example , مُسْلِمٌ becomes مُسْلِمُ , the word مُسْلِماتٍ becomes مُسْلِماتِ
2. If the word ends with letter ن , all you have to do is drop the ن. For Example : مُسْلِمون becomes مُسْلِمُو


<p class="note">
Note that the discussion of heavy and light becomes irrelevant when the word has an ال on it. This is
because تنوين and ال NEVER come together. For example, the word المسلِمٌ is incorrect. You can only say
المُسلِمُ. The words that end in ن, on the other hand, keep their ن even when there is an ال on the word.
The word المُسْلِمُون is correct; there is no need to drop the ن.
</p>


## Flexibility

**The Discussion of Flexibility only pretains to words that have an ending sound**

We will see Rafa, Nasab & Jarr of Singular form.

There are 3 forms of flexibility :

1. Fully Flexible ( مُنْصَرِف / مُعْرَب )
2. Partly Flexible ( مَمْنُوعٌ مِن الصَّرْفِ )
3. Non Flexible ( مَبْنِي )

### Fully Flexible ( مُنْصَرِف / مُعْرَب )
Fully Flexible is the default state of the word. Fully Flexible shows all three statuses in a normal way as we have learned in the Muslim Chart.

un , an, in - endings

### Non Flexible ( مَبْنِي )
Non-Flexible مَبْنِي words are opposite of fully flexible words. They can never show their status. This means that they look the same in the رفع status, نصب status, جر status.


Words that end with ألِف مَقْصُورة - ى or a normal ألِف - ا are non flexible.

Example - مُوْسَى  هُدًى , they will look same all 3 states - Raf'a , Nas'b, jarr

All pointer words ( أسماءُ الإشارة ) in the singular and plural forms as well as all of the أسماء موصولة  are non flexible. We will look at them in detail in later posts Inshallah.

### Partly Flexible  ( مَمْنُوعٌ مِن الصَّرْفِ )

Words that can display their status on 2 ways.

A partly flexible word can only take a ضمة and فتحة . 
A Partly flexible word can also never take tanween تنوين

Example : 
يُوْسُفُ (Raf'a), يُوْسُفَ (nas'b), يُوْسُفَ (Jarr status)

Unlike a non flexible word, there are times when a partly flexible word can be made fully flexible by showing a كسرة in the jarr form : 
1. By adding ال
2. By making it a مُضاف - We will discuss this in upcoming posts Inshallah


HOW TO INDENTIFY PARTLY FLEXIBLE WORDS : 

1. Non Arab Names
    
    Non arab names are partly flexible
    
    There are four Arab prophet’s names mentioned in the Quran. They are مُحمَّدٌ  هُوْدٌ  صالِحٌ  شُعَيبٌ

    There is 1 exception to this rule. 3 letter names with a sukoon on the middle letter are always fully flexible even if they are non arab names

    example :

    لُوْطٌ  لُوْطًا لُوْطٍ

    نُوْحٌ  نُوْحًا  نُوْحٍ

2. Feminine names and Uniquely Masculine names

3. Proper Names of Places
    
    Like مكَّةُ  مَكَّةَ  مَكَّةَ 

    Some places have ال in such cases the name is fully flexible like العِرافُ 

    Names of places that are three letters with a sukoon on the middle letter are fully-flexible.

That's it for part 2 , in the next blog we will see Pronouns in arabic , Fragments Inshallah
