Under Khabar - In previous blog we looked till 3 types audience of khabar 

## Tanzeel al-Munzila and its Categories

**Tanzeel al-Munzila (تنزيل المنزلة)** is a rhetorical device in Balagha, the art of Arabic eloquence. It means **to treat someone or something as if they hold a particular rank, status, or role, even if they do not, through a Khabar خبر (statement that is true/false & verifiable)**. This device creates a specific effect on the audience by manipulating their perception of the subject. 

Tanzeel al-Munzila involves **shifting someone or something from their actual position (A) to a perceived position (B or C), or vice versa**. These shifts can be understood as different categories of Tanzeel al-Munzila:

### Categories based on Audience Perception:

The sources describe three types of audiences in the context of Khabar:

*   **Neutral Audience (A):** They have no preconceived notions about the Khabar.
*   **Doubtful/Unsure Audience (B):** They are uncertain about the truthfulness of the Khabar.
*   **Refusing/Disagreeing Audience (C):** They actively reject the Khabar.

Based on these audience types, Tanzeel al-Munzila can be categorized as follows:

*   **Talking to someone who knows as if they don't know (A → B).** 
    
    Example, 

    وَٱصْنَعِ  ٱلْفُلْكَ  بِأَعْيُنِنَا  وَوَحْيِنَا  وَلَا  تُخَٰطِبْنِى  فِى  ٱلَّذِينَ  ظَلَمُوٓا۟  ۚ  إِنَّهُم  مُّغْرَقُونَ  - 11:37

    Build the Ark under Our watchful eyes and with Our inspiration. Do not plead with Me for those who have done evil - indeed they will be drowned.'

     إِنَّهُم  مُّغْرَقُونَ 
    Prophet Nuh (A.s) is always in agreement with Allah (SWT)'s command. Still Allah add emphasis with إِنَّهُم . Because sometimes we have a possibility of thought arising that if it is actually going to happen .
*   **Talking to a neutral audience as if they are unsure (A → B).** This technique can be used as a form of re-issuance, where the speaker wants to reaffirm a statement. For example, the phrase “shaqiq came dropping his spear; indeed your cousins have a lot of spears" addresses a neutral audience as if they were unsure, subtly prompting them to reconsider the statement and its implications.
    From Quran :

*   **Talking to someone unsure as if they are in disagreement (B → C).** This aggressive approach aims to eliminate any lingering doubts in the audience's mind.
*   **Talking to someone in disagreement as if they are neutral (C → A).** This technique downplays the weight of the audience's disagreement and can help de-escalate an argument. For example, stating "Medicine is helpful" to someone who vehemently disagrees with the use of medicine disregards their opposition and presents the statement as a neutral fact.
*   **Talking to someone unsure as if they are neutral (B → A).**  This approach normalizes the situation and addresses the unsure audience as if they have no doubts, creating a reassuring tone.
*   **Talking to a disagreer as if they are unsure (C → B).**  This technique acknowledges the audience's disagreement while subtly suggesting that their stance might stem from uncertainty rather than firm opposition.

### Categories based on Tense:

Tanzeel al-Munzila can also manipulate the audience's perception of time. The sources illustrate this with examples of Ism Faail (active participle) and Ism Maf'ool (passive participle) acting as verbs:

*   **Using Ism Faail and Ism Maf'ool to denote immediacy (Permanent → Temporary).** When used as verbs, Ism Faail and Ism Maf'ool describe actions that are happening in the present, emphasizing their temporary nature. For example, "You should praise Allah" presents praising as an ongoing action.
*   **Using Jumla Ismiya to denote permanence (Temporary → Permanent).** Jumla Ismiya, a nominal sentence without a فعل, suggests a state of being or a continuous action. For example, "A king being praised" describes an ongoing state of praise.

By shifting the audience's understanding of tense, Tanzeel al-Munzila can create a sense of urgency, emphasize the temporary nature of an action, or suggest the permanence of a situation.
