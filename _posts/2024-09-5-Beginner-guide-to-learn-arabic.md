### Guide to Learning Arabic: A Roadmap

Mastering Basic Nahw and Basic Sarf

Nahw (syntax) and Sarf (morphology) are two essential branches of Arabic grammar. Nahw focuses on the structure of sentences, teaching how words relate to each other, and how to form grammatically correct sentences. It helps to understand sentence components like subjects, verbs (Fi'l) , and objects, and how their roles change based on context. 

Sarf, on the other hand, deals with word formation, showing how Fi'l(similar to verbs in english but they are not same) and Ism (not exactly nouns in english) are derived from root letters and how they change to express tense, voice, and number. Together, Nahw and Sarf form the foundation for mastering Arabic grammar and understanding how the language works.

### Step 1 – Types of Words in Arabic

Arabic revolves around three main types of words:  
- اسم - Name of person ,place , thing, idea , adjective, adverb and more
- فعل - word that is stuck in time
- حرف - Word that doesnt makes sense unless an Ism or Fi'l is used with it, eg : to,from,with etc

Understanding how these categories work is crucial to building sentences. This stepcovers how words are categorized and introduces basic sentence structures.

Introduction: Understanding the core structure of Arabic sentences.

Status of Words (إعراب): Rafa,Nasab,Jarr - Learn how the role of a word in a sentence affects its grammatical case like if the Ism is doer in the sentence or detail.
