we have already looked at First kind of Insha - Command in previous blog part 5

### Second kind of إنشَاء Insha - النّهِي ( Forbidding )

Forms of النّهِي -

1. لا النّهِي

    Forbidding (Prohibition) -> فعل مضارع مجزوم (Lightest Fi'l Mudhar'i - 2nd person) + لا

2. لا النافية - Negation

    In rare cases, لا of Negation can be used for Forbidding (Prohibition) in Balagha

    Example -  لا تَعْبُدُون إلّا اللّه - You all (people) don't worship except Allah

    See here Fi'l Mudhar'i is not lightest



### The Meaning of النَهيِ

1. كلدُّعاء

    For Dua 

    Example -

    رَبَّنَا  لَا  تُؤَاخِذْنَآ  إِن  نَّسِينَآ  أَوْ  أَخْطَأْنَا  ۚ  رَبَّنَا  وَلَا  تَحْمِلْ  عَلَيْنَآ  إِصْرًا  كَمَا  حَمَلْتَهُۥ  عَلَى  ٱلَّذِينَ  مِن  قَبْلِنَا  


    eg here لَا  تُؤَاخِذْ  

2. والالتماس

    Requesting something from someone who is at same level as you.

    Example - "Hey don't touch that"

     يَٰٓأَيُّهَا   ٱلَّذِينَ   آمَنُوا   إِذَا   نُودِىَ   لِلصَّلَوٰةِ   مِن   يَوْمِ   ٱلْجُمُعَةِ   فَٱسْعَوْا۟   إِلَىٰ   ذِكْرِ   ٱللَّهِ   وَذَرُوا۟   ٱلْبَيْعَ  ۚ  ذَٰلِكُمْ   خَيْرٌ   لَّكُمْ   إِن   كُنتُمْ   تَعْلَمُونَ    

    فَٱسْعَوْا۟ (rush/hurry) is a command form but its an advice.It is not haram if you dont run to the masjid for jum'a ,  If someone is already in masjid from before (like if doing I'tekaf) then he doesn't have to go out of masjid and run towards it for Jum'ah prayer. 

     فَإِذَا   قُضِيَتِ   ٱلصَّلَوٰةُ   فَٱنتَشِرُوا۟   فِى   ٱلْأَرْضِ   وَٱبْتَغُوا۟   مِن   فَضْلِ   ٱللَّهِ   وَٱذْكُرُوا۟   ٱللَّهَ   كَثِيرًا   لَّعَلَّكُمْ   تُفْلِحُونَ    

    فَٱنتَشِرُوا۟  - disperse - Here command form is used but its not literally a command in meaning , it's actually <span class="hl"> a permission</span> that after prayer now you can go to your shops/office etc & do your job/business/other work


4. والدوام 

    when sometimes you tell someone to do something but you automatically include forver or never in it .

    [44:49]
    (… Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble!) [44:49]. Qatadah said: “This verse was revealed about the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl, who protested: ‘Is Muhammad threatening me? By Allah, I am the mightiest man between its two mountains [Mecca’s two mountains]’, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”. Abu Bakr al-Harithi informed us 

    (i)* 
    One day, the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, met Abu Jahl. The latter said to him: ‘You know that I am of the most powerful people on earth, and that I am the mighty, the noble!’ Allah, exalted is He, killed him at the Battle of Badr, humiliated him and reviled him, using his own words. This verse was revealed about him (Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble!)”.
