## Fragments in Arabic  

There are 5 Fragments :

1. **الجار والمجرور**
2. **حرف النّصب واسمها**
3. **الإضافة**
4. **الموصوف والصِّفَة**
5. **اسم الإشارة**


We have already studied about the first 3 fragments in Basic Nahw Part 3 here : [Link](https://blogs.arabicpathway.site/basic_nahw/2024/09/24/Basic-Nahw-Part-3.html)

# 4. الموصوف والصِّفَة :  

This fragment has two main components:

- **الموصوف**: The main noun (subject) we’re describing.
- **الصفة**: The adjective that describes the noun.

Unlike English, where adjectives precede nouns, in Arabic, the adjective follows the noun. Both parts of this fragment must match in all four noun properties.

Grammatically, a موصوف must match with its صفة in all four properties.

It’s important to note that when the names of Allah appear in succession, they are not considered *Mowsoof Sifah* even though they match in all four grammatical properties (gender, number, case, and definiteness). This is a common occurrence in the Quran and often emphasizes specific divine attributes individually rather than as modifiers of one another.

**Examples:**
- **العليم الحكيم** (The All-Knowing, The Wise)

# 5. The Pointing Fragment (اسم الإشارة)

Comprising two parts:

- **اسم الإشارة**: The pointing word, such as "this" or "that" in English.
- **المشار إليه**: The noun being pointed at.

- Both parts must match in all four properties.
- The noun pointed at must have a definite article (ال).
- No word can come between the pointing word and the noun.

Below are Ismul Isharah used for pointing at something that is NEAR. MEMORIZE them along with their meaning.

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><br></th><th><strong>Plural (هٰؤُلاءِ)</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Pair (هٰذانِ)</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Singular (هٰذا)</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Masculine</strong></td>
      <td>هٰؤُلاءِ (these)</td>
      <td>هٰذانِ (both of these)</td>
      <td>هٰذا (this)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Feminine</strong></td>
      <td>هٰؤُلاءِ (these)</td>
      <td>هٰتَان (both of these)</td>
      <td>هٰذِهِ (this)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Ismul Isharah Fragment vs in a Sentence

Forming Fragments and Sentences

  Fragment: Created when an Ism Ishara is followed by "Al" and then a noun matching in all four properties.
    
    Example: هذا الحديث (This speech)

  Sentence: Formed when an Ism Ishara is followed by a noun without "Al."
    
    Example: هذا ولد (This is a boy)


### Special Cases

  Pointing at an Idafa: When using an Ism Ishara with an Idafa (possessive phrase), place the Ism Ishara after the Idafa, not before. This avoids conflict with the Idafa's rule of the Mudaf being Marfu'.

    Example: سفارنا هذا (This journey of ours)

  Pointing at "Al" Words: To create a sentence when pointing to a noun with "Al," add a pronoun matching both the Ism Ishara and the noun between them.

    Example: هذا هو الرجل (This is the man). The pronoun "Hua" preserves the "Al" while forming a sentence.
