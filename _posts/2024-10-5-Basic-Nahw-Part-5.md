Every word in Arabic is either Masculine or Feminine . The Default Gender of an اسم is Masculine.

### How to know if an Ism is Masculine or Feminine

We will determine if a word is feminine or not there are certain groups ( 6 categories) of words that are feminine.

If a word doesn't fall under any these categories then it is Masculine.


1. Biologically Feminine

    That are Femine by nature like -

    Sister - أُخْتٌ

    Mother - أُمٌّ

2. Words that end with ة or اء or ى

    When a word has 3 letters and those 3 letters are followed by اء or ى , the word is considered feminine.

    Example - ذِكْرَى is feminine. But هُدًى is not feminine since it only has 2 letters before ى

    All words ending with ة are feminine

3. Body Parts in Pair

    The Following story will help you remember these words Inshallah

    During a حرب a soldier was daydreaming, looking up at the سماء until the شمس came up.When he snapped out of it, he realized that he was the only نفس left on the battlefield. He was surrounded by نار , so he used a دلو full of water to make a سبیل and طریق for himself to a safer أرض . In the hot, blowing ریح , he was desperately looking for a بئر to draw more water from. In his search, he found an empty دار inside which there was a كأس full of خمر . He remembered his fear of جھنم and السعیر , and he used his عصا to strike the drink.
