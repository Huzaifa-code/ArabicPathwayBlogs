Let's Learn Quranic Arabic Together.

# اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُم 
Welcome to my space dedicated to learning Quranic Arabic! My name is Huzaifa, and I am currently a student of Arabic grammar, aiming to share valuable resources and learning tools with fellow students. This website is not only a personal resource for me, but I hope, إِنْ شَاءَ ٱللَّٰهُ, that it becomes a helpful guide for many others on the same journey.

I began my Arabic studies with Bayyinah’s Dream Course and was deeply influenced by the early content of Ustadh Nouman Ali Khan on Bayyinah TV. This website brings together the knowledge and resources I’ve gathered along the way.

In addition to my passion for Arabic, I’m also a software engineer. The code for this site is open source, and I welcome contributions from anyone who wants to help improve it. Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or enhancing the user interface, your input is valuable.

If you have suggestions or ideas, feel free to create an issue in the GitHub repository or email me directly at developerhuzaifa@gmail.com.

Let’s learn, share, and grow together in our understanding of Quranic Arabic!
